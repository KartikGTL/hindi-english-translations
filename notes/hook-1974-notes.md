#Notes on "The Compound Verb in Hindi" by Peter Hook, 1974

##Section 1

*   What's the difference in meaning between e.g. *aao* and *aa jaao*?
    *   Porizka 1967, 1968, 1969 says (Hindi) simple:compound as Balto-Slavic imperfective:perfective
    *   Hacker 1958 thinks it's *Bestimmtheit* (definiteness), which is basically the same as what Porizka argues
    *   Hook: neither is useful pedagogically

##Section 2

*   Bahl argues (p. 4) that because Hindi is a literary language we should disregard what some informants say because they might be more wrong than the next. What?????
